9. Need to map "code_name" column to "codeName" field.
10. Done.
11. Done.
12. It can insert named parameters (instead of ?) into the sql query.
13. No, without @DirtiesContext annotation.
14. Now testCountryListStartsWithA runs correctly. Because without @DirtiesContext annotation context is created once before all tests. It means that DB is created once. setUp() method fills DB before each test. Therefore, DB becomes overfilled before second test. @DirtiesContext creates context before second test and DB as well. No overfilling.
15. Done.
16. Done.
17. Done.
18. Need to add to bean "dataSource" another one script, that contains insert queries for data from COUNTRY_INIT_DATA. Advantage is that the context is created with fully initialized DB.
